Welcome to phpMyAdmin 4.7.0, a regular maintenence release.

A complete list of new features and bugs that have been fixed is available in the ChangeLog file or
changelog.php included with this release.

A few highlights:
* Log failed authentication attempts to syslog (useful for parsing by fail2ban, for example)
* Add filtering for the database list
* Add table filtering to the database 'Structure' tab
* Add support for exporting user settings as a config.inc.php snippet
* Add option to delete settings from browser storage
* Changes to the JSON import and export format to better follow the JSON specification, however this breaks
  compatibilty with older versions. See https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/import_export.html#json
* Support for IPv6 proxies
* Allow more connection parameters for the controluser connection
* Rename 'Relations' to 'Relationships' in many places as it's a more correct term
* More documentation for export configuration options
* Remove support for Swekey authentication
* Remove support for old, unsupported versions of Microsoft Internet Explorer
* Removed $cfg['ThemePath']

Starting with this version, phpMyAdmin uses Composer to manage PHP library dependencies while under development.
Users downloading the official source distribution will not notice a difference, however users of the git repository
should refer to https://docs.phpmyadmin.net/en/latest/setup.html#installing-from-git for details.

There are many more improvements; please refer to the ChangeLog for full details.

As always, downloads are available at https://www.phpmyadmin.net
